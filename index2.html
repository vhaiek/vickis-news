    <h1><strong>The 20 Most Important Legal Technology Developments of 2018</strong></h1>
    <img src="images/image7.jpg" alt="Evolution from 2018 to 2019">
    <h4><em>By Bob Ambrogi on December 26, 2018</em></h4>
    <p>What a whirlwind of a year it has been for legal technology. Barely a week into 2018, industry-changing news broke of Avvo’s sale to Internet Brands. Legal tech news has been nonstop ever since – so much that it’s a struggle to keep up with it all.
    </p>
    <p>For several years now, I’ve closed out the year with a round-up of the 10 most important legal developments (2016, 2015, 2014, 2013). Last year, I bypassed the top 10 to focus on a single overarching development, The Year of Women in Legal Tech.
    </p>
    <p>This year, a top-10 list won’t suffice. So much of significance has happened that I can’t sum it all up in just 10 points. Instead, I’m doubling the list to offer my top 20 picks for the year’s most important legal technology developments.
    </p>
    <p>As in past years, the order in which I list these is not meant to be a ranking by importance. They are all important, each in their own way.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Analytics become essential.</h3>
    <p>If you were to judge the year’s most important legal technology by looking at conference agendas and media coverage, you’d probably say it was the continuing development of artificial intelligence. But if you judge the most important technology by its direct impact on the practice of law, then it would have to be analytics. As I suggested in a recent column, we could be nearing the point where it would be malpractice for a lawyer not to use analytics.
    </p>
    <p>At the center of the analytics story this year has been LexisNexis. Following its acquisitions of Lex Machina in 2015 and Ravel Law, it has been steadily working to build on the foundations established by those products and integrate them into its legal research platform Lexis Advance. It has steadily expanded the practice areas covered by Lex Machina’s analytics, and from Ravel it added both visual search results and the unique Context analytics that examine the language of judges’ opinions. The defining moment for LexisNexis this year came in July, when it put a stake in the ground to claim the analytics space.
    </p>
    <p>But LexisNexis was by no means the only legal analytics story this year. Thomson Reuters also put down its claim with the launch of its next-generation research platform Westlaw Edge, which for the first time brought detailed docket analytics to the Westlaw research platform. Elsewhere in the legal world, Fastcase released its Analytics Workbench, which it said would allow legal professionals to build their own bespoke litigation analytics, and judicial analytics company Gavelytics got new funding and expanded the scope of its coverage.

    <h3>2. Legal tech goes global.</h3>
    <p>Legal tech has long been provincial in its perspective. Here in the U.S., we’ve tended to focus on what was happening here in the U.S., ignoring and therefore ignorant of legal tech developments elsewhere in the world. But this year, that changed dramatically. The world of legal tech got flatter. That was largely thanks to the Global Legal Hackathon.
    </p>
    <p>This audacious effort by organizers who had never before run even a local hackathon turned out to be a huge success. They rallied participation by 600-1,000 teams in 40 cities and 22 countries around the world. During the hackathon, they dispatched Dera Nevin as their own “global ambassador for legal technology,” who visited 19 destinations in 15 countries on six continents over 40 days to meet with hackers and entrepreneurs. The ultimate winners came from locations as diverse as Budapest, Hong Kong, Denver and New York.
    </p>
    <p>And it showed us that we are not provincial in the problems we seek to address or the solutions we are developing. To a surprisingly large degree, the problems that face the legal and justice systems in any one country are the problems shared by every country. And all over the world, hackers and entrepreneurs and others are working fervently to come up with the tech to solve these problems.
    </p>
    <p>I was fortunate enough this year to see some of this personally. In April, I traveled to Lexpo, one of the leading legal technology conferences in Europe, where I got to speak with lawyers and entrepreneurs from all over Europe. More recently, I was in Moscow for Skolkovo Legal Tech, a leading Russian legal technology conference. Both events reinforced this idea that the problems we face and the solutions we’re developing are largely universal.

    <h3>3. Legal research gets smarter and more comprehensive.</h3>
    <p>Given that it started off with a “robot fight” between two AI-driven legal research products, you knew 2018 was going to be a momentous – and even pugilistic – year for legal research. Not only did research get smarter, thanks to a whole new generation of tools powered by AI and natural language processing, but it also got more expansive, thanks to a momentous project that put all U.S. case law online.
    </p>
    <p>On the pugilism front, it was a year in which legal research platforms introduced product after product designed to make their research platforms “smarter” and to further separate them from their competitors. That started with ROSS Intelligence’s introduction of EVA, a brief-analysis tool similar in concept to the previously released CARA from Casetext and Clerk from Judicata. That led to the aforementioned robot fight, which I broadcast on Facebook Live, and to a string of similar products introduced throughout the year, including Vincent from vLex, Attorney IO, and CaseIQ from Casemine, as well as to major updates to the product that started it all.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond brief analysis, this was the year in which Thomson Reuters introduced Westlaw Edge, the next generation of its industry-leading legal research platform, that LexisNexis put a “stake in the ground” to claim the legal analytics space with its Lexis Analytics, and that the American Association of Law Libraries selected Bloomberg Law’s AI-powered Points of Law as new product of the year.
    </p>
    <p>In this increasingly competitive market, the gloves came off in September when Casetext released a study comparing its CARA against Lexis Advance and concluding that attorneys who used its product finished their research significantly more quickly and found more relevant cases. Lexis cried foul, criticizing the study as biased and tainted by flawed methodology.
    </p>
    <p>And even as Casetext and Lexis sparred, Fastcase and Casemaker continued their longstanding competition for the bar-affiliation market. In court, Fastcase won a key victory in an ongoing legal battle with Casemaker over copyright in Georgia administrative regulations. In the market, Fastcase scored a deal to become the legal research member benefit for the 60,000-member California Lawyers Association.
    </p>
    <p>Then, in October, news came that brought uniform acclaim across the legal research field. Harvard Law’s Caselaw Access Project had completed its project to digitize all U.S. case law, some 6.4 million cases dating all the way back to 1658. As if overnight – although the scanning and digitization took some three years – decades-long visions of full electronic access to case law became a reality.
